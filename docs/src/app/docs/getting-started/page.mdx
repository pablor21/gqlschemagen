# Getting Started

GQLSchemaGen makes it easy to generate a GraphQL schema from your Go models. This guide walks you through installation, setup, and your first generated type.

## Installation

You can install GQLSchemaGen in your project using either of these methods:

### Option 1: Install via `go install`

<Snippet>
  go install github.com/pablor21/gqlschemagen/cmd/gqlschemagen@latest
</Snippet>

This will install the tool as a binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`.

### Option 2: Add as a project dependency

<Snippet>go get github.com/pablor21/gqlschemagen</Snippet>

> **Note:** If you installed with `go get`, you can run the tool using `go tool gqlschemagen` instead of a global binary.

---

## Initialize your project

We recommend starting by running:

<Snippet>gqlschemagen init</Snippet>

This will create a `gqlschemagen.yml` configuration file in your project root. This file is where you can specify which packages to scan, output paths, naming conventions, and other options. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for full details.

---

## Annotate your first type

Add GraphQL annotations to your Go structs using comments above your type:

<CodeBlock language="go" filename="models/user.go">
  {`/**
 * @GqlType(name:"UserProfile",description:"Represents a user in the system")
 */
type User struct {
    ID   string
    Name string
}`}
</CodeBlock>

These annotations tell GQLSchemaGen how to map Go types to GraphQL object types.

---

## Generate your schema

Once your structs are annotated, generate the GraphQL schema:

<Snippet>gqlschemagen generate</Snippet>

This will produce a `schema.graphql` file with your types. For example, the `User` struct above generates:

<CodeBlock language="graphql" filename="schema.graphql">
  {`"""
Represents a user in the system
"""
type UserProfile @goModel(model: "your-package.User") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}`}
</CodeBlock>

> **Tip:** Use `gqlschemagen generate --watch` during development to automatically regenerate the schema whenever you change your types.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first type generated, you can explore the `gqlschemagen.yml` configuration to customize package scanning, naming conventions, directives, and more. Check out [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for full details.
