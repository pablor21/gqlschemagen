# Introduction

GQLSchemaGen is a lightweight code-generation tool for Go projects that use GraphQL. It inspects your Go models and DTOs and produces a complete `schema.graphql` file, allowing you to keep your schema definition in sync with your types instead of maintaining it manually.

The tool aims to reduce boilerplate, enforce consistency, and give teams a predictable way to map their Go structures to a GraphQL API. By relying on tags and simple configuration, it stays approachable even in larger projects with many models.

## Goals

- Provide a straightforward, annotation-driven workflow for generating GraphQL schemas.
- Eliminate manual schema maintenance and the risk of type drift.
- Support real-world Go codebases without forcing architectural changes.
- Keep configuration minimal while offering flexibility through tags.
- Generate clean, human-readable GraphQL output that can be committed and reviewed like any other file.

## Features

- **Schema generation from Go structs**
  Reads your model and DTO packages and converts them into GraphQL object types.

- **Support for directives and custom tags**
  Add descriptions, field names, optionality, and directives through struct tags.

- **Enum generation**
  Converts Go enums (via `iota` or const values) into GraphQL enums.

- **Input type generation**
  Build input schemas directly from DTO structs designed for mutations or filters.

- **Automatic handling of pointers, slices, maps, and nested types**
  Produces correct nullability and GraphQL type mappings without manual intervention.

- **Full support for generics**
  Generates concrete gql types from your go generic structs

- **Configurable output**
  Control which packages are scanned, where files are written, and how names are mapped.

- **Deterministic output for Git diff-friendly schemas**
  Object, field, and enum ordering is stable, making reviews clean.

## Non Goals - Non Features

- **Not a GraphQL server**  
  GQLSchemaGen only generates schema files. It does not provide a GraphQL server implementation, query execution, or resolver runtime. Use it alongside libraries like [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) or [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql) for server functionality.

- **Not a runtime validator**  
  The tool operates at build/generation time, not runtime. It does not validate incoming GraphQL queries or enforce business logic.
